# vi Keybinds

Implements vi bindings as a mode in Textadept.

While everybody thinks of vi as a cohesive package, it was originally just the interactive mode of the ex editor. POSIX actually specifies a basic set of commands that make vi, vi. The original editor was fairly spartan, and was cloned and improved many times as vim, nvi, elvis, vile, etc.

vi motion and command bindings are somewhat esoteric and non-intuitive, but for users that are already used to them, they can be a highly efficient way of navigating and modifying a document.

This package is not intended to implement any features of vi or vim that Textadept is missing. Rather, it simply maps the existing functionality of Textadept onto the standard vi keybinds.
